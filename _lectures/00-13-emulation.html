<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a> was a mathematician who developed a game known as the Game of Life. He died in April 2020, but since he invented the game, he was in effect ‘god’ for this game. But as we will see, just inventing the rules doesn’t give you omniscience in the game.</p>
<p>The Game of Life is played on a grid of squares, or pixels. Each pixel is either on or off. The game has no players, but a set of simple rules that are followed at each turn the rules are.</p>

<p>John Conway’s game of life is a cellular automata where the cells obey three very simple rules. The cells live on a rectangular grid, so that each cell has 8 possible neighbors.</p>

<p>And that’s it. Those are the simple ‘physical laws’ for Conway’s game.</p>
<p>The game leads to patterns emerging, some of these patterns are static, but some oscillate in place, with varying periods. Others oscillate, but when they complete their cycle they’ve translated to a new location, in other words they move. In Life the former are known as <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Oscillator">oscillators</a> and the latter as <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Spaceship">spaceships</a>.</p>

<p>John Horton Conway, as the creator of the game of life, could be seen somehow as the god of this small universe. He created the rules. The rules are so simple that in many senses he, and we, are all-knowing in this space. But despite our knowledge, this world can still ‘surprise’ us. From the simple rules, emergent patterns of behaviour arise. These include static patterns that don’t change from one turn to the next. They also include, oscillators, that pulse between different forms across different periods of time. A particular form of oscillator is known as a ‘spaceship,’ this is one that moves across the board as the game evolves. One of the simplest and earliest spaceships to be discovered is known as the glider.</p>

</div>
<p>The glider was ‘discovered’ in 1969 by Richard K. Guy. What do we mean by discovered in this context? Well, as soon as the game of life is defined, objects such as the glider do somehow exist, but the many configurations of the game mean that it takes some time for us to see one and know it exists. This means, that despite being the creator, Conway, and despite the rules of the game being simple, and despite the rules being deterministic, we are not ‘omniscient’ in any simplistic sense. It requires computation to ‘discover’ what can exist in this universe once it’s been defined.</p>

<p>These patterns had to be discovered, in the same way that a scientist might discover a disease, or an explorer a new land. For example, the Gosper glider gun was <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Bill_Gosper">discovered by Bill Gosper in 1970</a>. It is a pattern that creates a new glider every 30 turns of the game.</p>
<p>Despite widespread interest in Life, some of its patterns were only very recently discovered like the Loafer, discovered in 2013 by Josh Ball. So despite the game having existed for over forty years, and the rules of the game being simple, there are emergent behaviours that are unknown.</p>

<p>Contrast this with our situation where in ‘real life’ we don’t know the simple rules of the game, the state space is larger, and emergent behaviors (hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanos, climate change) have direct consequences for our daily lives, and we understand why the process of ‘understanding’ the physical world is so difficult. We also see immediately how much easier we might expect the physical sciences to be than the social sciences, where the emergent behaviors are contingent on highly complex human interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The curve described by a simple molecule of air or vapor is regulated in a manner just as certain as the planetary orbits; the only difference between them is that which comes from our ignorance. Probability is relative, in part to this ignorance, in part to our knowledge. We know that of three or greater number of events a single one ought to occur; but nothing induces us to believe that one of them will occur rather than the others. In this state of indecision it is impossible for us to announce their occurrence with certainty. It is, however, probable that one of these events, chosen at will, will not occur because we see several cases equally possible which exclude its occurrence, while only a single one favors it.</p>
<p>— Pierre-Simon Laplace <span class="citation" data-cites="Laplace-essai14">(Laplace, 1814)</span>, pg 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The representation of ignorance through probability is the true message of Laplace, I refer to this message as “Laplace’s gremlin,” because it is the gremlin of uncertainty that interferes with the demon of determinism to mean that our predictions are not deterministic.</p>
<p>Our separation of the uncertainty into the data, the model and the computation give us three domains in which our doubts can creep into our ability to predict. Over the last three lectures we’ve introduced some of the basic tools we can use to unpick this uncertainty. You’ve been introduced to, (or have yow reviewed) <em>Bayes’ rule</em>. The rule, which is a simple consequence of the product rule of probability, is the foundation of how we update our beliefs in the presence of new information.</p>
<p>The real point of Laplace’s essay was that we don’t have access to all the data, we don’t have access to a complete physical understanding, and as the example of the Game of Life shows, even if we did have access to both (as we do for “Conway’s universe”) we still don’t have access to all the compute that we need to make deterministic predictions. There is uncertainty in the system which means we can’t make precise predictions.</p>
<p>I like to call this “Laplace’s Gremlin.” Gremlins are imaginary creatures used as an explanation of failure in aircraft, causing crashes. In that sense the Gremlin represents the uncertainty that a pilot felt about what might go wrong in a plane which might be “theoretically sound” but in practice is poorly maintained or exposed to conditions that take it beyond its design criteria. Laplace’s gremlin is all the things that your model, data and ability to compute don’t account for bringing about failures in your ability to predict. Laplace’s Gremlin is the uncertainty in the system.</p>

<h2 id="monolithic-system">Monolithic System</h2>
<p>The classical approach to building these systems was a ‘monolithic system.’ Built in a similar way to the successful applications software such as Excel or Word, or large operating systems, a single code base was constructed. The complexity of such code bases run to many lines.</p>
<p>In practice, shared dynamically linked libraries may be used for aspects such as user interface, or networking, but the software often has many millions of lines of code. For example, the Microsoft Office suite is said to contain over 30 million lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="service-oriented-architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</h2>
<p>Such software is not only difficult to develop, but also to scale when computation demands increase. For example, Amazon’s original website software (called Obidos) was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obidos_(software)">monolithic design</a> but by the early noughties it was becoming difficult to sustain and maintain. The software was phased out in 2006 to be replaced by a modularized software known as a ‘service-oriented architecture.’</p>
<p>In Service Oriented Architecture, or “Software as a Service” the idea is that code bases are modularized and communicate with one another using network requests. A standard approach is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a>. So, rather than a single monolithic code base, the code is developed with individual services that handle the different requests.</p>
<p>The simulation software is turned inside out to expose the individual components to the operator.</p>

<p>This is the landscape we now find ourselves in for software development. In practice, each of these services is often ‘owned’ and maintained by an individual team. The team is judged by the quality of their service provision. They work to detailed specifications on what their service should output, what its availability should be and other objectives like speed of response. This allows for conditional independence between teams and for faster development.</p>
<p>One question is to what extent is the same approach possible/desirable for scientific models? The components we listed above are already separated and often run independently. But those components themselves are made up of other sub-components that could also be exposed in a similar manner to software-as-a-service, giving us the notion of “simulation as a service.”</p>

<p>One thing about working in an industrial environment, is the way that short-term thinking actions become important. For example, in Formula One, the teams are working on a two-week cycle to digest information from the previous week’s race and incorporate updates to the car or their strategy.</p>
<p>However, businesses must also think about more medium-term horizons. For example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year’s car. So while you’re working on updating this year’s car, you also need to think about what will happen for next year and prioritize these conflicting needs appropriately.</p>
<p>In the Amazon supply chain, there are the equivalent demands. If we accept that an artificial intelligence is just an automated decision-making system. And if we measure in terms of money automatically spent, or goods automatically moved, then Amazon’s buying system is perhaps the world’s largest AI.</p>
<p>Those decisions are being made on short time schedules; purchases are made by the system on weekly cycles. But just as in Formula 1, there is also a need to think about what needs to be done next month, next quarter and next year. Planning meetings are held not only on a weekly basis (known as weekly business reviews), but monthly, quarterly, and then yearly meetings for planning spends and investments.</p>
<p>Amazon is known for being longer term thinking than many companies, and a lot of this is coming from the CEO. One quote from Jeff Bezos that stuck with me was the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I very frequently get the question: ‘What’s going to change in the next 10 years?’ And that is a very interesting question; it’s a very common one. I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?’ And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two – because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. … [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,’ [or] ‘I love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver a little more slowly.’ Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed, it’s a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is going to happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that there was constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making delivery fast and improving selection. For example, shortly before I left Amazon moved its entire US network from two-day delivery to one-day delivery. This involves changing the way the entire buying system operates. Or, more recently, the company has had to radically change the portfolio of products it buys in the face of Covid19.</p>
<!--These challenges are not just there for Amazon and Formula 1. In Sheffield, we worked closely with a Chesterfield based company called Fusion Group. They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole. While costs have come down, the number of PTFE weld failures went up. Eric's company focussed on new systems for auto-->

</div>
<p>From the perspective of the team that we had in the supply chain, we looked at what we most needed to focus on. Amazon moves very quickly, but we could also take a leaf out of Jeff’s book, and instead of worrying about what was going to change, remember what wasn’t going to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t know what science we’ll want to do in five years’ time, but we won’t want slower experiments, we won’t want more expensive experiments and we won’t want a narrower selection of experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, our focus was on how to speed up the process of experiments, increase the diversity of experiments that we can do, and keep the experiments price as low as possible.</p>
<p>The faster the innovation flywheel can be iterated, then the quicker we can ask about different parts of the supply chain, and the better we can tailor systems to answering those questions.</p>
<p>As a result, our objective became a two-order magnitude increase in number of experiments run across a five-year period.</p>

<p>A statistical emulator is a data-driven model that learns about the underlying simulation. Importantly, learns with uncertainty, so it ‘knows what it doesn’t know.’ In practice, we can call the emulator in place of the simulator. If the emulator ‘doesn’t know,’ it can call the simulator for the answer.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>As well as reconstructing an individual simulator, the emulator can calibrate the simulation to the real world, by monitoring differences between the simulator and real data. This allows the emulator to characterize where the simulation can be relied on, i.e., we can validate the simulator.</p>
<p>Similarly, the emulator can adjudicate between simulations. This is known as <em>multi-fidelity emulation</em>. The emulator characterizes which emulations perform well where.</p>
<p>If all this modelling is done with judicious handling of the uncertainty, the <em>computational doubt</em>, then the emulator can assist in desciding what experiment should be run next to aid a decision: should we run a simulator, in which case which one, or should we attempt to acquire data from a real-world intervention.</p>

<p>The expectation of <span class="math inline">\(f(U )\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\int_\mathbf{ x}f( \mathbf{ x})\text{d}\mathbf{ x}\)</span>.

<p>The result can be compared with the actual mean of the Branin function which is 54.31.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can fit a GP model and compute the integral of the best predictor by Monte Carlo sampling.</p>
<p>Firstly, we create the covariance function. Here we’re going to use an exponentiated quadratic, but we’ll augment it with the ‘bias’ covariance function. This covariance function represents a single fixed bias that is added to the overall covariance. It allows us to deal with non-zero-mean emulations.</p>

<p>In the sinusoid example above, we learnt the variance of the process. But in this example, we are fitting an emulator to a function we know is noise-free. However, we don’t fix the noise value to precisely zero, as this can lead to some numerical errors. Instead, we fix the variance of the Gaussian noise to a very small value.</p>

<p>It’s a common error in Gaussian process fitting to initialize the length scale too small or too big. The challenge is that the error surface is normally multimodal, and the final solution can be very sensitive to this initialization. If the length scale is initialized too small, the solution can converge on an place where the signal isn’t extracted by the covariance function. If the length scale is initialized too large, then the variations of the function are often missing. Here the length scale is set for each dimension of inputs as 3. Now that’s done, we can optimize the model.</p>

<p>Finally, we can compute the mean of the model predictions using very many Monte Carlo samples.</p>
<p>Note, that in this example, because we’re using a test function, we could simply have done the Monte Carlo estimation directly on the Branin function. However, imagine instead that we were trying to understand the results of a complex computational fluid dynamics simulation, where each run of the simulation (which is equivalent to our test function) took many hours.

<p>We’re introducing you to the optimization and analysis of real-world models through emulation, this domain is part of a broader field known as surrogate modelling.</p>
<p>Although we’re approaching this from the machine learning perspective, with a computer-scientist’s approach, you won’t be surprised to find out that this field is not new and there are a range of research groups interested in this domain.</p>
<p>This type of challenge, of where to run the simulation to get the answer you require is an old challenge. One classic paper, <span class="citation" data-cites="McKay-selecting79">McKay et al. (1979)</span>, reviews three different methods for designing these inputs. They are <em>random sampling</em>, <em>stratified sampling</em> and <em>Latin hypercube sampling</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the input values <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{ x}_n\)</span> be a random sample from <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{ x})\)</span>. This method of sampling is perhaps the most obvious, and an entire body of statistical literature may be used in making inferences regarding the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using stratified sampling, all areas of the sample space of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span> are represented by input values. Let the sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span> be partitioned into <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> disjoint strata <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi = P(\mathbf{ x}\in S_i)\)</span> represent the size of <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>. Obtain a random sample <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_{ij}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, \dots, n\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>. Then of course the <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> sum to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(I = 1\)</span>, we have random sampling over the entire sample space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The same reasoning that led to stratified sampling, ensuring that all portions of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> were sampled, could lead further. If we wish to ensure also that each of the input variables <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_k\)</span> has all portions of its distribution represented by input values, we can divide the range of each <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_k\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> strata of equal marginal probability <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span>, and sample once from each stratum. Let this sample be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_{kj}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(j = 1, \dots, n\)</span>. These form the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_k\)</span> component, <span class="math inline">\(k = 1, \dots , K\)</span>, in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \dots, n\)</span>. The components of the various <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}_k\)</span>’s are matched at random. This method of selecting input values is an extension of quota sampling (Steinberg 1963), and can be viewed as a <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-dimensional extension of Latin square sampling (Raj 1968).</p>

<p>The paper’s rather dated reference to “Output from a Computer Code” does carry forward through this literature, which has continued to be a focus of interest for statisticians. <a href="http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/">Tony O’Hagan</a>, who was a colleague in Sheffield but is also one of the pioneers of Gaussian process models was developing these methods when I first arrived there <span class="citation" data-cites="Kennedy-bayesian01">(Kennedy and O’Hagan, 2001)</span>, and continued with a large EPSRC funded project for managing uncertainty in computational models, <a href="http://www.mucm.ac.uk/" class="uri">http://www.mucm.ac.uk/</a>.
